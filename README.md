snuggle
=======

Eventually an iPad app with a subset of Wikipedia:Huggle's functionality.

This is mostly meant for my own personal use - I thought one day "wouldn't it be lovely if I could have Huggle but for iPad, for on trains or buses" - but I've opened up the code for ease of contributions and storage.

Usage notes
-----------

I offer no guarantees about the stability of this *alpha* app for production ENWP usage.

Use at your own risk, just like WP:Huggle, but with *even more* caution.
